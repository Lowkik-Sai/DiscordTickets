Please go to the v2 branch for the current version of the code and documentation . \u26a0\ufe0f The following information is about v3. Please read the README file on the v2 branch for information that is about the current version. What is this? \u00b6 DiscordTickets is a Discord bot for creating and managing \"support ticket\" channels. It is a free and open-source alternative to the popular paid \"premium\" and \"white-label\" ticketing bots, such as Ticket Tool , TicketsBot , Tickety , Helper.gg , Helper , and others. DiscordTickets is feature-rich and much more customisable than many of the bots mentioned above. As it is intended for self-hosting, the bot can have your community or company's logo, for free. Although intended for use in a single Discord server, the bot can also function in multiple servers at once if run more than one community. Features \u00b6 DiscordTickets is packed full of features, many of which were suggested by its users. If it's missing a feature you want, you can: Create a plugin for it, if you can code JavaScript Request someone else to make a plugin Submit a feature request if you think many other users would benefit from it Here's some of the things that makes DiscordTickets awesome: Highly customisable Some messages can be configured for each server and for each ticket category. Every other message is set in the locale files, making it relatively easy to override the default messages. You can also configure the functionality of the bot to your liking and add commands with plugins. Localisable If the bot hasn't already been translated to your (community's) language, you can translate it yourself. Plugin authors are encouraged to support multiple languages as well. Multiple ticket categories Each ticket category has its own settings for messages and the support team roles. There's also multiple methods of creating a ticket. A beautiful ticket archives portal Add the official DiscordTickets-Portal plugin for an instant ticket archives website. Plugin support Developers can add a lot of functionality to DiscordTickets without modifying the source code by creating plugins. Plugins can listen for client and ticket events, create commands, and more. DiscordTickets-Portal is an example of what can be done with plugins. Open-source and self-hosted It's yours. Supports multiple databases DiscordTickets uses Sequelize to allow you to choose from SQLite, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, or MSSQL for your database, with very little setup. If you choose SQLite, which is the default as it is the easiest, you don't need to do anything! If you choose to use another database (recommended), you only need to install the package(s) with NPM and create the database. All of the database tables are created automatically, regardless of which database type you use. Screenshots \u00b6 screenshot of a ticket channel screenshot of a panel Getting started \u00b6 Host it yourself Fully managed hosting Public test bot Recommended if you have a host and you've done this before.
